### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm developing iOS (and macOS) apps since 2009 if you need help kicking-off your Startup with a fresh mobile app, or need someone to help you maintain and update your existing one. Feel free to [reach out to me](https://bearologics.com/contact).

I'm a CTO-as-a-Service and Founder & CEO of [@Bearologics](https://github.com/Bearologics).
